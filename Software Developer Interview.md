## Design a system a web based system to accept payments

__Using any environment of your choice, design a web based eshop that accepts payments via credit card and third party system (say a bank). Your system should:__
* List Items for sale
* Allow one to add an item to a cart
* Pay using a credit card (you can use sandbox from any of your prefered providers)
* Allow one to choose to pay through a bank by cash. Your system would then communicate with the bank's system via a secure interface to get a notification when the payment has been made. This is KEY
* Store keepers should be able login and update stock but can't buy
* An administrator should be able to login to the same system to view some graphical reports


__In this assignment, you will demonstrate:__
* Database design
* Experience in setting up and web-based systems
* Experience in APIs (bank's interface)
* Other design consinderations such as agility, security, modularity
* Experience with frameworks (if you happen to use any)
* Design principles (such as MVC)
* Use of code repositories
* Responsiveness of your applications

__How to submit__
* Upload your project to code repository of your choice (such as github, gitlab) and send us email to info@tmcg.co.ug with the subject "Interview Submission". The email should include:
	+ Link to the repository where your work was uploaded
	+ A few screenshots from the system  (these may also be uploaded to the repo and you just indicate ther link)
	+ A brief description of how the system works/is designed (this can also be in Readme file in the repo)

__Next Steps__
* Short listed applicants will be invited to present their work in an oral interview
